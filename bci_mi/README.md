# EEG classification: 
Use EEG data and labels to separate right and left hand movement imagery. Find the common spatial patterns for each hand combinations of components that maximize the variance between the two), keep 3 filters with highest and lowest variance explained. Use linear discriminant analysis to separate the two (find weights for the model).
